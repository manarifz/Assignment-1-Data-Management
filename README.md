# Infectious Insights: Spatiotemporal Analysis of COVID-19 and STDs in Malaysia

## Introduction

As Malaysia continues to advance in digital healthcare and public health surveillance, data-driven insights have become increasingly vital in managing and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for robust data management, analysis, and visualization techniques to support real-time decision-making and resource allocation in the healthcare sector. Similarly, the rising prevalence of other infectious diseases such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) poses significant public health challenges that require timely monitoring and intervention.

## Problem Statement

Infectious diseases continue to present major health concerns in Malaysia, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the availability of large volumes of health-related data, there exists a gap in transforming these raw datasets into meaningful insights that can drive policy and public health decisions. Specifically, there is a need to explore how the trends of COVID-19 and sexually transmitted diseases have evolved across different regions and time periods in Malaysia.

## Objective

This study aims to uncover patterns, identify hotspots, and generate actionable insights that can inform healthcare planning, disease prevention, and public awareness initiatives.
